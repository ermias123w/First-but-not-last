    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    If you're a fan of our banana bread, then you're gonna love this, since it's based on that recipe. As easy as that is to make, these are even easier.
  <br>I really think that this threads the needle between something that has the flavor of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. 
  <br>Top with butter and banana slices and serve with warm maple syrup.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large ripe banana</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk.
          <br> Reserve until needed.</li>
        <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher.
          <br>Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.
          <br>Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</li>
        <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat.
          <br>Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake.
          <br>Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about
          <br> 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
